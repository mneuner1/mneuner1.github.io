    <h2>
      <b> Most deaths by police don’t involve body cameras</h2>

    <p class="story-text">In almost 90% of cases in which people were killed by police from 2015-2020, the police officer involved was not wearing a body camera. Though body cameras are used to record forensic evidence at crime scenes and record officers’ interactions with the public, keeping them accountable, many departments don’t seem to be enforcing the use of them.</p>

    <p class="story-text-indent">These staggering statistics may increase already ripe distrust in the police force. Data is not yet available for after 2020, but the Black Lives Matter movement increased distrust in police after the killing of George Floyd. “Defund the police” became a popular phrase among left-wing activists. In a time when the pro-police sentiment is standing on thin ice, the lack of body camera use in instances when a civilian is killed by a police officer is likely to stir negative emotions in those who value transparency.</p>

<h2>
  <b> More people killed by police show “no signs of mental illness”</h2>

<p class="story-text">In many cases of killings by police, the person killed by the police officer did not show “signs of mental illness.” But how are those signs being spotted?</p>

<p class="story-text-indent">Certain mental illnesses can be more clear, but often the symptoms of mental illness lie below the surface. The reported numbers from 2015 to 2020 show that over three-quarters of the people police killed didn’t show signs of mental illness, and less were reported as showing signs of mental illness each year, while the number of those with “no signs” continued to rise. This may show that police are becoming reluctant to categorize people as mentally ill just by visible traits—or that the times when people hear about a crazy person getting killed by the cops have been overdramatized.</p>
