          <h2 style="font-size: 16px"><p>By Madison Neuner</br>
          August 11, 2023</p></h2></br>

          <p class="article-heading">United States climate action</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 16px"><p>In response to the ongoing threat of climate change, countries all over the world have been formulating plans to combat greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, which contribute directly to rising global temperatures. The United States is part of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement" target="_blank">Paris Climate Agreement</a> that went into effect in 2016. This agreement requires signing countries to commit to more ambitious climate action plans every five years.</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S.’s most recent <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-06/United%20States%20NDC%20April%2021%202021%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">climate action plan</a>, from 2021, aims for the country to be 50-52% below 2005 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. In order to achieve that goal, the Biden Administration passed the ambitious Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). But the <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/" target="_blank">Climate Action Tracker (CAT)</a> believes that more plans need to be implemented to reach that 50-52% decrease, and marks the U.S.'s efforts as “insufficient” as of August 2022.</p></h2>

          <h2 style="font-size: 16px"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Driscoll, a professor in Syracuse University’s department of civil and environmental engineering, helped to develop <a href="https://experts.syr.edu/en/publications/us-clean-energy-futuresair-quality-benefits-of-zero-carbon-energy" target="_blank">research</a> about proposed policies to get the U.S. to zero carbon emissions. The researchers simulated the potential effects of these plans, and almost all of them saw major positive benefits. “They paid for themselves—in many cases, many times over,” he said.</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue with instituting federal plans, Driscoll said, is that many plans stall in Congress. “If Congress got their act together and they would, they would implement a new program for the electric utility industry. But they haven't done that.”</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states have taken matters into their own hands with their own individual plans. “States like California and New York are doing this because it applies pressure on the country as a whole,” Driscoll said. “But it's a very inefficient way to do it.” A national—and international—effort is necessary to combat the issues that the world faces due to climate change.</br></br></p></h2>


            <p class="article-heading">New York's plan</p>
            <p><h2 style="font-size: 16px">New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, passed in 2019, claims to be one of the most ambitious plans in the nation, and the world. The state’s <a href="https://climate.ny.gov/Resources/Scoping-Plan" target="_blank">Scoping Plan</a> under the Climate Act aims for “a reduction in economywide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050 from 1990 levels.”</br>
          
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the availability of renewable energy is another major pillar of this plan. It recommends investing in infrastructure to store renewable energy, which can power the grid instead of GHG-emitting resources like natural gas or coal.</p></h2></br></br>

          <p class="article-heading">Energy storage in New York</p>
          <h2 style="font-size: 16px"><p>New York State has started over 4,000 energy storage projects since October 2011; almost 90% of those started after the state’s Scoping Plan was signed into law in July 2019 (see figures 1 and 2). “Battery energy storage systems help to ensure there is enough electricity available during peak use and/or lower generation periods, which is when the grid needs battery storage the most,” said a spokesperson for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many large-scale storage projects are focused on a combination of standalone projects, which contain both renewable and non-renewable energy sources, and systems that are paired with large-scale solar and wind projects. According to the NYSERDA spokesperson, these projects contribute heavily to New York’s plan for a “decarbonized electric grid” by storing large quantities of renewable energy, like solar power and land-based and offshore wind. Having this energy stored will help to offset fossil fuel emissions by providing more renewable energy to the grid.</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York’s first benchmark for energy storage is six gigawatts of battery energy storage by 2030. This is a stepping stone to the goals of about 12 gigawatts by 2040 and more than 17 gigawatts by 1050. Currently, there are 292 megawatts installed and operational, and more than a gigawatt of projects “in the pipeline,” the NYSERDA spokesperson said.</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current projects get New York to almost 5% of their 2030 goal; if the projects in the pipeline are all installed, the state will be more than 20% of the way there. The state still needs to put a lot of work into adding new projects in order to be on track.</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the NYSERDA spokesperson, <a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/-/media/Project/Nyserda/Files/Programs/Energy-Storage/ny-6-gw-energy-storage-roadmap.pdf" target="_blank">New York’s 6 GW Energy Storage Roadmap</a>, filed by the Department of Public Service (DPS) and NYSERDA in December 2022, proposes the implementation of NYSERDA-led programs towards procuring an additional 4.7 GW of new storage projects across the bulk (large-scale), retail (community, commercial and industrial), and residential energy storage sectors in New York State. These future procurements, combined with the existing energy storage already under contract with the State and moving towards commercial operation, will allow the State to achieve the 6 GW goal by 2030.</p></h2></br>

          <p class="article-heading">Transmission and capacity</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 16px"><p>Driscoll said that the infrastructure of storage and transmission of renewable energy both create “bottlenecks.” There have been many advancements in transmission infrastructure in recent years, like <a href="https://www.cleanpathny.com/about-project/about-clean-path-ny" target="_blank">Clean Path New York</a>, the Public Service Commission’s (PSC) <a href="https://dps.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/02/pr23015.pdf" target="_blank"> approval</a> of 62 transmission projects in upstate New York, and furthering efforts to transmit offshore wind energy. These will help provide energy to other parts of New York State when it’s needed.</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmission is especially important when considering that the counties with the most people don’t have as much energy in their county as others (see figure 3). For example, Queens County has a population of almost 2.5 million people, but only has a storage capacity of 5.76 kWac per 10,000 people—that’s enough to power <a href="https://realgoods.com/4880w-off-grid-residential-solar-power-system-base-kit-2" target="_blank">one home</a>.</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counties with less people and higher capacity may have to transmit that power to counties with more people. For example, Madison County has a population of 66,387 people and a storage capacity per 10,000 people of 1,888 kWac. With the help of new transmission projects in the state, these higher-capacity areas may be able to transmit energy to more densely populated areas.</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, New York is heading in the right direction. “I'm confident that we have the technology and the ability to do it,” Driscoll said. “We just have to get serious about it.”</p></h2></br></br>

            <p><span class="huge-quotation2">"</span><h4>It's a very heavy lift. It's a huge lift. But, you know, we're trying to save the planet here. It's a big task, but it's hugely important.</h4></p>
